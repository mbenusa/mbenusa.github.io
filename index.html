    <h1><b>Work History</b></h1>
    <p>In May 2021, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelors of Arts in English and Film Studies. Shortly after, I took a job with The Young Turks, an online political media corporation. During my tenure, my responsibilities focused on audio-visual distribution across multiple numerous content platforms including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and more. On a daily basis, I wrote titles that are factual, accurate, and free of grammatical errors. Additionally, I manipulated owned and licensed photography and videography to create eye-catching thumbnails that captured the core audience.</p>
    <p>While at Carnegie Mellon, I was the editor-in-chief of the student newspaper from January 2020 through December 2020. At the onset of the pandemic, we transitioned to an entirely virtual format for the formerly print-forward paper. I managed the transition, creating an online engagement plan with a goal of reaching 5,000 constituents (the paper's print circulation). In one semester, we consistently reached about 750 opens of our weekly newsletter, with some weeks reaching well over 1,000 opens. On top of that, we revamped our Twitter and Instagram presence to reach an engaged audience of students. Reaching an audience of 5,000 within one year was an ambitious goal, but the brand strategy ultimately worked, leaving me and the team at the paper satisfied with our work.</p>
    <p>Before my year as editor-in-chief, I spent a year on editorial staff as the sports editor and a year as a staff writer. My writing interests included film and book reviews, sports commentary and feature writing, and occasional opinion pieces on issues with the American carceral system. Of late, my writing has tended more toward fiction, film scripts, and commentary on higher education, using contemporary novels to complement more traditional data and news sources.</p>
    <p>On the side, I've volunteered with Literacy Pittsburgh. Through the non-profit, I was connected with an ESL student seeking to pass a High School Equivalency Test. We've met twice weekly for a few months, and in that time, I've developed a passion for teaching and education. It certainly helps that the student is sharp, making my job much easier. Additionally, I've been learning web design on my own to build this portfolio website.</p>

      <h4>Matthew Benusa</h4>
      <p>Since graduating from Carnegie Mellon, I've started my long journey through adulthood by taking a job in the online media industry. Along the way, I've rediscovered my passions for plants and animals, novels and pop music, and sports and creativity. Outside of my 9-5, I try to play basketball down the street from my apartment in Pittsburgh, PA or spend a little time reading or writing. My cat, a 3 year old orange tabby, is named Sunny.</p>
