   <p>Evangelical religion exists more as a vague modifier of established Protestant religions than a strict religious denomination in and of itself. Many Protestant denominations are preceded with the qualifier ‘evangelical’ before the stated religion, for example evangelical Anglicanism, evangelical Lutheranism, or evangelical Presbytarians. However, there are also numerous denominations that spawned out of the Great Awakenings in the United Kingdom and the United States that are descendants of the original evangelical mission. That is to say, evangelicalism exists as a broadly unified set of Protestant principles, rather than a strictly organized theological creed. There is the presence of religion, or a belief in God and the Book, in the principles of evangelicalism, but evangelicals will often eschew the more academic versions of theology. Instead, they focus on daily, holy action. There is less emphasis on many aspects of ritualistic theology, like Catholic rites during Sunday mass, and more of an emphasis on action that is Christ-like from everyone, even the lowest person. Taking Hannah More’s “Periodical Religion” as an example of the principles that unite evangelical Christians, the theology of a religious life focuses on a morally good life that does not affect sweeping change, which is antithetical to a revolutionary politics of the working class, choosing instead to promote a more conservative politics.
   </p>
   <p>In Hannah More’s “Periodical Religion,” she delineates the qualities of a pious, religious life that “weav[es] our devotions and our actions into one uniform tissue, by doing all in one spirit, and to one end” (3). Often, evangelicalism is associated with four distinct tenets—crucicentrism, biblicism, conversionism, and activism. These tenets create important theological separations between evangelicals and other Protestant denominations, but the tenets often lead to the central goal of the evangelical way of life, which is a life united with spirituality. For the first part of the essay, More establishes the difference between a ‘periodical religion’ and the evangelical life, and within that difference are the four distinct parts of an evangelical theology. A periodical religion is defined as having “discernment enough to distinguish sin, but not firmness enough to oppose it” (1). Evangelicals believe that Jesus Christ died to heal our sins, therefore it is our duty to live a life free of sin, and that is the way crucicentrism relates back living the evangelical life. It is the goal of an evangelical life to have the firmness to oppose sin, like Jesus Christ did when he died on the cross. In order to get to the point of opposing sin, an evangelical must have a moment of conversion, or as More calls it, penance: “a periodical religion is accompanied with a periodical repentance” (4). To lead an evangelical life, “there must be an entire repentance” (4). Biblicism is a belief in the Bible existing as the central holy text direct from God through prophets, so when More writes, “of which sacrifices, that is, of the spirit in which they are offered, the Almighty has said, ‘I cannot put up with them: they are iniquity,’” she is citing the Bible directly to make a point about the spirit with which an evangelical life should be lived (2). Finally, the activism of evangelical life is rarely discussed in More’s essay, except near the end of the argument, she writes, “The most insignificant people must not, through indolence and selfishness, undervalue their own influence” (5). Insignificant people, people in poverty and the working class, must also take on the evangelical spirit, as they are just as important as the most significant of people. The evangelical life, which is about doing things in one spirit, is not a spirit of revolution, but a spirit of conservatism. 
   </p>
   <p>On top of the theological argument against a periodical religion, More develops an argument that suggests an evangelical life is not a radical life. More writes, “Providence has set narrow bounds to life; piety should proportionally narrow our anxieties respecting it; for to be inordinately enamored with any object, the worth of which will not justify the attachment, argues an ill-regulated mind and a defective judgment” (4-5). More’s philosophy does not take on the same explicitly political meaning in this text as it does in “Village Politics,” but the philosophy takes a conservative bent when applied to a working class situation, which is what More does in “Village Politics” and hints at when she discussed the power of insignificant people in activating the evangelical spirit. When the argument that there are narrow bounds to life, that piety will calm the revolutionary anxieties, is applied to a working class situation by way of describing “insignificant people,” the philosophy becomes politically conservative. More’s political conservatism is not necessarily explicit in “Periodical Religion,” but the basis of her religious philosophy is developed; the religious philosophy is then developed into a political philosophy in another text, “Village Politics.”
   </p>
   <p>The explicit political argument of “Village Politics” takes place in two parts of the text: the dialogue, where Jack Anvil provides the point of view of the author, and the non-dialogue elements, which serve to prepare a popular audience for the dialogue in the scene. Namely, the title page with its dedication and pen name are examples of non-dialogue elements that provide political meaning. On the title page, the text reads, “Village Politics: Addressed to All the Mechanics, Journeymen, and Day-Labourers, in Great Britain,” which is authored by Will Chip, “a country carpenter.” Directing the text toward the working class of Great Britain sets the stage for later political commentary in the dialogue by Jack Anvil, who is a representative of the author’s point of view because of his lengthy, didactic passages. Not only is the text specifically addressed to the working class, Will Chip’s profession as a carpenter is loaded with Christian resonance. Will Chip is not necessarily a metaphorical representation of Jesus Christ, but Chip’s carpentry definitely provides an allegorical and religious resonance to a clearly political text. Another piece of evidence before the dialogue is the name of each character. Both are working class, Jack Anvil the blacksmith and Tom Hod the mason, so the political meaning of the text works in a direct way with the intended audience, simple working men, reading characters in their same class situation spell out More’s suggested politics for the working class. In the dialogue, More’s politics are clear.
   </p>
   <p>The two characters have a conversation that spans a number of political ideas like liberty, revolution, and monarchy, with Jack’s dialogue taking up most of the scene as Tom is a sounding board for Jack’s political suggestions of conservatism. Tom, discussing Paine’s Rights of Man, never makes any judgements about the topic of equality, and his speech is limited. Jack, on the other hand, continues for most of page 6 of “Village Politics,” saying, “Now, Tom, only suppose this nonsensical equality was to take place,” which aligns with More’s comment about the narrow bounds established by providence. Equality is nonsensical for members of the working class, which matches with the philosophy of narrow bounds to life. Later, Tom brings up social issues of the times in a single sentence: “But the times—but the taxes, Jack” (8). Tom does not present a convincing argument for his side. Jack presents the alternative by saying, “Besides things are mending, I hope and what little is done, is for us poor people...if the honest gentleman is not disturbed by your levellers, things will mend every day.” Directly citing a revolutionary religious group, the levellers, Jack is saying that a pious life does not revolt against the established social convention, and in fact, revolution will make the times even worse. The levellers are responsible for the temptation of honest gentleman, according to Jack, and without the levellers, things will return to normal. One of the things the levellers fought for during their time of political import was limitation on monarchy, and Jack Anvil delivers a quip to Tom in response to his position on the current structure of the English government: “I am a better judge of a horse-shoe than Sir John, but he has a better notion of state affairs than I.” This line of conservative thought regarding everyone’s specific state in life—the affairs of state belong to the statesmen, the horseshoe is shod by the blacksmith—culminates in a line that is made to be explicitly about providence, not government, “For the woman is below her husband, and the children are below their mother, and the servant is below his maker.” Jack’s politics, which are the politics of Hannah More, shows More to be against revolution, following the conservative line of thought that exists as part of the guidelines of an evangelical life. 
   </p>
   <p>Some of More’s conservative thought follows the same arguments that Burke proposes in Reflections on the Revolution, and even in More, there are citations about the French Revolution being antithetical to the ideas of evangelicalism. Both of their arguments focus on the virtue of delayed gratification, suggesting that people should not try to change their station in life, and that if they follow these principles, they will receive eternal reward. The connection of the religious virtue of delayed gratification for eternal reward to More’s conservative politics of the working class is reminiscent of Max Weber’s argument in The Protestant Work Ethic. Weber argues that protestantism led to the development of capitalism across Europe because of the role delayed gratification plays in religious thought, which leads to delayed gratification in everyday life. In the future, the possibility of exploring Hannah More’s work as a specific instance of that development of religious thought into action seems resonant, especially considering her focus on the piety or virtue of remaining in your station in life to earn eternal reward.
