   <p>Economic issues are the center of any argument around fracking. Time and time again, various people and organizations do cost-benefit analyses of the environmental cost of fracking, the employment cost of fracking, and the investment cost of fracking, but every time, the analysis ends up different depending on the ethical equations of environmentalism versus economic expansion. Whether the cost of unemployment or water pollution is more important to the analysis, the end result will be fracking is good or fracking is bad, respectively. However, a more recent strain of environmentalists have developed a traditional economic argument against fracking.
   </p>
   <p>From 2018, a headline from Pittsburgh City Paper reads, “Natural-gas proponents and renewable-energy advocates disagree on fracking’s potential to grow jobs in Pittsburgh,” and a number of other reports from the paper focus on the lack of jobs and economic investment that fracking has brought to Western Pennsylvania.<sup>1</sup> According to statistics from 2019, there were only 26,000 jobs in the oil and gas industries in PA.<sup>2</sup> The number of jobs supported by oil and gas in the state are much higher than stated, however. Plastic, food, construction, transportation, and electricity all depend on the subsidized extraction of natural gas and oil in the state and across the United States. That means the economic issue at stake in fracking is not simply the oil and gas industry, but the foundations of the American economy. American economic hegemony in the world was established by its ability to produce cheap oil and natural gas, subsidized by foreign wars and foreign investment in the U.S. oil and gas industry. Essentially, the economic environmentalists are arguing that more jobs in the renewable sector are equivalent to the economic breadth of the oil and gas industry. 
   </p>
   <p>At the same time as the “local economies of thought” rhetoric of jobs and local investment, there is the “big feeling economies” rhetoric of globalism and nationalism present in the debate of fracking. Because of the gas industry’s relationship to American hegemony, there is a nationalist undercurrent to fracking. One blog on drilling at the Marcellus Shale writes, “we are in a fight to the (economic) death with people who hold a dangerous philosophy. They are people who are, in part, funded by Russia, working against America’s best interests.”<sup>3</sup> Similarly, environmental advocates discuss the benefits of renewable energy sources on the world environment. Pollution, according to Bill McKibben, is a thing of the past.<sup>4</sup> The localized effects of natural gas drilling are lost to the globalizing effect of climate change rhetoric.
   </p>
   <p>Falling on two different levels of local economies of thought and big feeling economies, fracking and natural gas extraction of the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Western PA has a rhetorical problem where jobs in the oil and gas industries and cheap, subsidized fossil fuels are innumerably important to local economies. Because cheap fossil fuels are inextricably tied with American nationalism, the rhetoric of fracking is also tied to the rhetoric of a nation’s foundational industry. Renewable energy sources are tied to globalism by way of climate change.
   </p>
   <p>Local environmental groups like PennEnvironment or the Pennsylvania Environmental Council would have an interest in this report, along with local policy makers and local investors dedicated to clean energy expansion. The issue at stake in this report is less the economic prospects of clean energy, but the agreement of a society to move into clean energy production, which is challenging when American economic hegemony is founded on cheap petrochemicals.
