   <p>Economic issues are the center of any argument around fracking. Time and time again, various people and organizations do cost-benefit analyses of the environmental cost of fracking, the employment cost of fracking, and the investment cost of fracking, but every time, the analysis ends up different depending on the ethical equations of environmentalism versus economic expansion. Whether the cost of unemployment or water pollution is more important to the analysis, the end result will be fracking is good or fracking is bad, respectively. However, a more recent strain of environmentalists have developed a traditional economic argument against fracking.
   </p>
   <p>From 2018, a headline from Pittsburgh City Paper reads, “Natural-gas proponents and renewable-energy advocates disagree on fracking’s potential to grow jobs in Pittsburgh,” and a number of other reports from the paper focus on the lack of jobs and economic investment that fracking has brought to Western Pennsylvania.<sup>1</sup> According to statistics from 2019, there were only 26,000 jobs in the oil and gas industries in PA.<sup>2</sup> The number of jobs supported by oil and gas in the state are much higher than stated, however. Plastic, food, construction, transportation, and electricity all depend on the subsidized extraction of natural gas and oil in the state and across the United States. That means the economic issue at stake in fracking is not simply the oil and gas industry, but the foundations of the American economy. American economic hegemony in the world was established by its ability to produce cheap oil and natural gas, subsidized by foreign wars and foreign investment in the U.S. oil and gas industry. Essentially, the economic environmentalists are arguing that more jobs in the renewable sector are equivalent to the economic breadth of the oil and gas industry. 
   </p>
   <p>At the same time as the “local economies of thought” rhetoric of jobs and local investment, there is the “big feeling economies” rhetoric of globalism and nationalism present in the debate of fracking. Because of the gas industry’s relationship to American hegemony, there is a nationalist undercurrent to fracking. One blog on drilling at the Marcellus Shale writes, “we are in a fight to the (economic) death with people who hold a dangerous philosophy. They are people who are, in part, funded by Russia, working against America’s best interests.”<sup>3</sup> Similarly, environmental advocates discuss the benefits of renewable energy sources on the world environment. Pollution, according to Bill McKibben, is a thing of the past.<sup>4</sup> The localized effects of natural gas drilling are lost to the globalizing effect of climate change rhetoric.
   </p>
   <p>Falling on two different levels of local economies of thought and big feeling economies, fracking and natural gas extraction of the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Western PA has a rhetorical problem where jobs in the oil and gas industries and cheap, subsidized fossil fuels are innumerably important to local economies. Because cheap fossil fuels are inextricably tied with American nationalism, the rhetoric of fracking is also tied to the rhetoric of a nation’s foundational industry. Renewable energy sources are tied to globalism by way of climate change.
   </p>
   <p>Local environmental groups like PennEnvironment or the Pennsylvania Environmental Council would have an interest in this report, along with local policy makers and local investors dedicated to clean energy expansion. The issue at stake in this report is less the economic prospects of clean energy, but the agreement of a society to move into clean energy production, which is challenging when American economic hegemony is founded on cheap petrochemicals.
   </p>
   <h3 style="text-align:center">Local Interests</h3>
   <p>Any local thought about fracking begins with employment and investment in local natural gas extraction. A report from Deloitte, republished by the Marcellus Shale Coalition, starts with a plainspoken fact, “Today it [Appalachia] is the third largest [natural gas producer], trailing only the full United States and Russia.”<sup>5</sup> The report goes on to describe the massive potential economic impact, based on the highest estimates, believing that the Western PA, West Virginia, and Upstate New York could see massive profits through at least 2040. In fact, the China Energy Investment Corp announced $83 billion in investments in West Virginia’s shale industries in 2017. The potential economic impact of turning away from fracking natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales should not be understated. It would lead to a loss in investment and employment that would likely take decades to recover without policy intervention, so proponents of fracking often cite the local employment of many of the people who work on wells. In a letter to the PA Attorney General, the Marcellus Shale Coalition wrote, “Employees of the natural gas industry live in the very communities in which we operate.”<sup>6</sup> While the truth of that statement may be mixed, it is an example of how local thought relies on employment and investment in the natural gas industry.
   </p>
   <p>Local thought around employability is even present in a commercial from 2012, released by Range Resources, a $2.8 billion natural gas production company in the Marcellus Shale. “Now thanks to our abundant natural gas, manufacturing is on its way back, and for a new generation, opportunity awaits,” says the narrator, and the commercial ends on the tagline, “Drilling is just the beginning.”<sup>7</sup> The local thought around employability extends beyond the limits of the natural gas industry to the manufacturing industry, the plastics industry, and more because the commercial is right. Drilling is just the beginning of a working local economy. This easily leads to overinflation of fracking job numbers, like local Congressional candidate Sean Parnell’s suggestion that ending fracking could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and President Donald Trump’s suggestion that it could cost almost 700,000 jobs in PA.<sup>8</sup> This means that local thought tends to over-inflate the importance of fracking employment in the state, but local environmentalists then tend toward under-inflating the importance of fracking writ large.  
   </p>
   <p>Environmentalists who over-inflate renewable jobs will not work, either, but a report for the PA Department of Environmental Protection found that employment in the clean energy generation sector grew by 6.5% in 2019 with most new jobs coming in the solar energy sector, which could offer a solution.<sup>9</sup> The report also found that the clean energy corporations in PA are struggling to hire new people. 80% of clean energy companies reported some struggle to hire new people, and almost all of those companies said that lack of applicants or lack of education or relevant skills was the reason why they struggled. The recent refocusing of local thought on the importance of clean employment is a step forward, and to take another step, refocusing the local thought on the potential growth of clean energy employment and investment in communities in Western PA and across the U.S. will benefit the local thought and the economies of big feelings. However, local thought is not the end of the issue with fracking in Western PA.
